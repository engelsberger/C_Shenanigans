# What the hell is this?

Simple project ideas I wrote while being bored during lectures.

Contains:
- Conways game of life
- driving school (a simple console game)

# conways_game_of_life.c

A simple, well known program that creates an immersive gamefield with cells living and dying following four rules:
- Cells with one or less neighbours die
- Cells with two or three neighbours live on
- Cells with four or more neighbours die
- Empty spaces with three neighbours create a new cell

# driving_school

A little console game where you have to dodge obstacles on a road. Base game controls are:
- W/S for up/down
- A/D for left/right
- X to quit
Score points are added once an obstacle has cleared the screen.
